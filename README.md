# computorV1

Python program solving 2nd degree equation

## Usage

./computor.py \<Your equation\>

## Example

$> ./computor.py "2X^2 + 4X + 2 = 0"\
Reduced equation: 2+4.0X+2.0X^2.0 = 0\
a = 2.0\
b = 4.0\
c = 2\
Calculating discriminant delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0.0\
Discriminant is 0, unique solution is\
-1.0
